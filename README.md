## Introduction and Aims ##

Please see below for the following brief given by Codecademy for the project:

>For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

The web application takes a csv file containg data from the popular card game 'Cards Against Humanity' and produces a random answer when prompted. This project was completed to personally gain experience in JavaScript, develop a basic understanding of version control using git, and begin collaberation with github.

### Aims ###

1. Build a message generating program using JavaScript
2. Use Git version control
3. Connect the JavaScript application to a website
4. Collaberate using the platform GitHub
